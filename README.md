## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Deep Dive & Architecture

This project is a modern showcase of native Apple development, built with the latest technologies and best practices.

### Core Technologies
* **UI:** 100% **SwiftUI**, embracing a declarative and platform-adaptive approach.
* **Data Persistence:** **SwiftData** for a robust, modern, and type-safe data layer synced via CloudKit.
* **Concurrency:** Modern concurrency with **`async/await`**, **`ModelActor`** and **`Task`** used throughout, especially for IAP and AI operations.
* **In-App Purchases:** **StoreKit 2** for managing subscriptions (`DailyLock+`) and one-time tips (`TipsView`).
* **On-Device AI:** **FoundationModels** (`@Generable`) for generating `WeeklyInsight` summaries securely and privately on-device.
* **Testing:** A comprehensive suite of **UI Tests** (`XCTest`) and **Unit Tests** (Swift Testing framework) to ensure reliability and quality.

### Architectural Highlights
* **Dependency Management:** A centralized `AppDependencies` observable class is used to manage and inject shared services (like `DataService`, `Store`, `HapticEngine`, `NavigationContext`) into the SwiftUI environment, promoting a clean and testable architecture.
* **MVVM-inspired Design:** The app uses a modern interpretation of MVVM, with views like `TodayView` delegating their logic and state management to observable classes like `EntryViewModel`.
* **Custom View Modifiers:** The codebase makes extensive use of custom modifiers like `.cardBackground()`, `.premiumFeature()`, and `.trackDeviceStatus()` to create a consistent design system and encapsulate view logic.
* **Advanced UI Components:**
    * `ConfettiView` & `StreakAchievementView`: Fun, animated views to celebrate user achievements.
    * `TipsView`: A highly animated and interactive view for in-app tipping, featuring floating hearts and a dynamic progress goal.
* **Robust Error Handling:** A centralized `ErrorState` manager queues and presents user-friendly alerts for different error types (`DatabaseError`, `StoreError`, `IntelligenceError`).

## ‚úÖ Testing

The project includes both UI and Unit tests to ensure code quality.

* **UI Tests (`/DailyLockUITests`)**: Cover key user flows like onboarding, creating and locking entries, navigating the timeline, and interacting with the paywall.
* **Unit Tests (`/DailyLockTests`)**: Use the new Swift Testing framework to validate the logic of models, view models, and utility classes like `StreakCalculator` and `NavigationContext`.

To run the tests, open the Test Navigator in Xcode (`Cmd + 6`) and click the play button.
